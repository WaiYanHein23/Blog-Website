    <p className='text-white text-lg p-2'>I’ve always considered myself a creative person and I know that I am my best when I am with people. I knew that I love community, having fun, and seeing people smile. I’ve turned to many outlets in my life to use my creative vision and love for people in an impactful way, and there’s two avenues I’ve felt really click- entrepreneurship and philanthropy.

When it comes to giving back, I owe so much to the mission of Operation Impact that’s lit a fire inside my heart. I’ve been blessed to serve on the creative team for over a year now and work a bit “BTS”, while also using my creativity and love for writing into effect to spread the heart of OI through social media. Whether it’s casting vision with the other volunteers on our team, curating an IG reel, finding the perfect words for a caption, or being in front of the camera making a hype video, I’ve had so much fun helping to spread the mission!

Now that it’s fall and the holidays are approaching faster than we know it, I am SO excited for our biggest initiative, Operation Holiday Impact! I’ve been part of this campaign since its inception in 2017, and I am blown away at the growth over the years. Serving with OI has helped me realize that my gifts can be used in new, creative ways, particularly in fundraising. Turns out, I LOVE coming up with unique ways to get people excited about OHI (and Operation Impact in general) and bring people together to raise money for a good cause.

The good news is, you don’t have to be a super extrovert like me, or even feel extremely creative to create a fundraising campaign or help others get involved. Here’s some ideas I’ve implemented so far, or others to try out:</p>
